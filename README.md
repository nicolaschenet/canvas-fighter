***

![Ryu is getting sprited...](http://distilleryimage10.instagram.com/eed8db44196111e2b18c12313b0892dc_7.jpg)

### Goal

> The main goal is to experiment with HTML5 / Canvas / Javascript, not really to make an actual game :)

#### Overall character's control and animation:
 - Pre-fight animation
 - Moving left, right (depending on challenger's position)
 - Jumping
 - Crouching
 - Blocking attacks
 - Special moves
 - Win / Lose animation

#### Including sounds
 - Moves sounds
 - Stage sounds

#### How to run it ?
Just open canvas-fighter.html in a modern browser...
(An internet connexion is required to load jQuery stuff ^^)

### Changelog

[See changelog here](https://github.com/nicolaschenet/canvas-fighter/wiki/Changelog)

#### Next step...

Yeahhh the sprite is still buggy... I have to recompose the sprite so that each frame has the same width and height. Will be the next step, with the creation of all animations (keyframes sequences).
